    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A grilled cheese sandwich is a simple, warm comfort food made by grilling slices of bread with cheese in between. The bread is typically buttered on the outside for a golden, crispy texture, while the inside becomes soft and gooey as the cheese melts. It is often served alone or with soup.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>2 slices of cheese (e.g., cheddar, American)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter one side of each bread slice.</li>
        <li>Place one slice, buttered side down, in a skillet.</li>
        <li>Add cheese slices on top, then cover with the second bread slice, buttered side up.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat until golden brown, about 2â€“3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, slice, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
