        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A peanut butter and jelly (PB&J) sandwich is a classic American snack or meal consisting of two slices of bread spread with peanut butter and fruit jelly or jam. The peanut butter provides a creamy or crunchy texture with a rich, nutty flavor, while the jelly adds sweetness and moisture, typically made from grape, strawberry, or other fruit preserves. This combination creates a balance of salty and sweet tastes, and is often served cold or at room temperature. PB&J is simple, affordable, and widely popular, especially among children.</p>
